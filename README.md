# Networks-Theory
# README

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive network analysis of Victor Hugo's classic novel "Les Mis√©rables," revealing the intricate social dynamics and character interactions within the narrative. The analysis includes network characteristics, centrality measures, degree distribution, and community detection, using Python and relevant libraries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib pandas
```

## Files Included
- `lesmiserables.gml`: The network dataset file.
- `Networks Theory.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.

## Project Structure
1. **Abstract**: A summary of the analysis, highlighting key findings.
2. **Introduction**: Description of the network, its importance, applications, and classification. Includes a network visualization.
3. **Network Characteristics**: Measures size, number of links, average path length, clustering coefficient, and distance metrics.
4. **Centrality Measures**: Analysis based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
5. **Degree Distribution**: Plot and analysis of the degree distribution.
6. **Community Detection**: Community analysis, visualization of the communities, and observations.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of insights from all analyses.

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `Networks Theory.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells. The notebook includes all steps to load the dataset, perform the analysis, and generate visualizations.
